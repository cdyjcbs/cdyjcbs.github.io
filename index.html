              Cody Jacobs is passionate about helping students of all levels
              discover their voice and grow as performers. Born and raised in
              Illinois, he attended the University of Illinois, where he studied
              vocal performance. Since graduating, he has dedicated himself to
              mastering his own voice and sharing that knowledge with his
              students through personalized and engaging instruction.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the Music Director at Roaming Gnome Theatre and a private voice
              instructor, he honed his skills in directing, music direction, and
              teaching. His approach to voice combines mental, physical, and
              vocal training, emphasizing that a deep understanding of all three
              is essential for authentic and effortless performance. He is a
              dedicated student of Estill Voice Training, developed by the late
              Jo Estill, and continues to explore advanced techniques to stay at
              the forefront of vocal and bodywork methodologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Cody’s mission is to create a supportive environment that nurtures
              creativity, confidence, and technical excellence. He constantly
              seeks opportunities to deepen his expertise by working with top
              professionals in the industry. Whether you’re a beginner or an
              experienced performer, he is committed to helping you achieve your
              musical and performance goals.

              "Hi! My name is Margot and I take voice lessons with Cody at
              Roaming Gnome Theater. First of all, I love working with Cody
              because he teaches me lots of vocal techniques I didn’t know yet
              and how to improve my vocal work. When I get into the car to leave
              the lesson, I want to go back inside to have another hour-long
              lesson. Cody is a great teacher because every week that I walk
              into voice lessons, I walk out having learned so many things that
              make my voice better. Some techniques we have been working on are
              breathing, holding a long note/being grounded, parts of the body
              used for singing, being speech-like/relaxed, having purpose, and
              even acting within the song. Cody really meets me wherever I’m at
              and takes me to another level I did not think was possible to get
              to. His sense of humor and energy are only a few reasons I love to
              work with him. I have had many experiences with vocal teachers,
              but none of them have been as productive or fun to be around as
              Cody."

              "Cody has helped me tremendously as a singer! He gave me the
              confidence I needed to perform in front of a crowd and helped me
              overcome obstacles with singing that I have faced since childhood.
              He taught me techniques and tools I never learned before in my 43
              years which helped me significantly improve as a singer. He has
              also been a wonderful teacher to my daughter and I'm incredibly
              thankful for all of the direction and guidance he has given her
              over the years."

              "Cody really helped me with my voice throughout the years. He
              taught me how to use my voice as a singer. When I was in my 4th
              grade talent show, he really helped me become stronger in that
              song, and more comfortable. He was also a great director for "Guys
              and Dolls", he gave each and every one of us individual time to
              help us work on a solo, or a big number, or maybe a scene with
              other characters. Cody is also a great mentor! He helped me get
              into Denver School of the Arts, he would help me pick the pieces
              for my audition, and after I was memorized would help me with the
              character. Overall Cody is a great vocal coach, a great director,
              and a great mentor. He will really help out anyone."

            <p>
              "My daughter has been working on vocal lessons with Cody for the
              past year, and prior to that, in a team setting for several
              musical stage productions. We have had nothing but wonderfully
              positive experiences with Cody, both personally and
              professionally, in every setting. He sets high expectations for
              all of his students and supports them steadfastly in their efforts
              to meet them. We have seen tremendous growth in our child's
              confidence as well as her vocal control and power since she began
              working with him. Cody is also a strong communicator and
              scheduler, making my busy schedule a bit more manageable. We are
              so grateful to get to work with Cody on a weekly basis and can't
              wait to see how much more our daughter will achieve under his
              insightful instruction supported by his deep knowledge and
              experience."
