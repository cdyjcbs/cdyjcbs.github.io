            Cody loves the opportunity to put his skills to use in coaching
            cast and vocalists through shows. It is an exciting challenge to
            learn and understand the sound quality associated with each show
            and figure out how to translate the idea and sound to individuals
            and ensembles alike.

          <h3>Margot</h3>
          <h2>DSA Theatre Major</h2>
          <p>
            Hi! My name is Margot and I take voice lessons with Cody at Roaming
            Gnome Theater. First of all, I love working with Cody because he
            teaches me lots of vocal techniques I didnâ€™t know yet and how to
            improve my vocal work. When I get into the car to leave the lesson,
            I want to go back inside to have another hour-long lesson. Cody is a
            great teacher because every week that I walk into voice lessons, I
            walk out having learned so many things that make my voice better.

          <h3>Tess C.</h3>
          <h2>DSA Theatre Major Parent</h2>
          <p>
            My daughter has been working on vocal lessons with Cody for the past
            year, and prior to that, in a team setting for several musical stage
            productions. We have had nothing but wonderfully positive
            experiences with Cody, both personally and professionally, in every
            setting. He sets high expectations for all of his students and
            supports them steadfastly in their efforts to meet them.
